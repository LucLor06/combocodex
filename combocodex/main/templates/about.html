            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>ComboCodex is a passion project built out of its community's love for team combos! The website was built by me, yes me, and improved with the help of its community. ComboCodex has been rebuilt four times since its conception in early 2023, this is mostly due to it being the first website I ever made, and I am constantly learning new things and improving! For those curious ComboCodex is mostly built with <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a>, and <a href="https://hyperscript.org/">Hyperscript</a>. If you need to reach out to me or have any additional questions you can reach out to randiddlecus <a href=" https://discord.gg/5n4JWMb">on our discord</a>.</p>
